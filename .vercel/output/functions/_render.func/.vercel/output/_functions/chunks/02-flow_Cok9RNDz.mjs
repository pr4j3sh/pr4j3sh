But it's not just about learning; sharing that knowledge with the community is equally important. In this blog, I'll walk you through my process of learning, taking notes, and publishing my findings, all while using tools like Obsidian and Git.\n\n## Starting with an Idea\n\nEvery learning journey begins with a sparkâ€”an idea of what I want to explore. This could be a new programming language, a framework, or a deeper dive into a concept I'm already familiar with. As I begin, I often discover additional topics that I find intriguing and worth pursuing. I document these new topics in my Obsidian notes vault, ensuring I never lose track of potential areas of growth.\n\n## Taking Notes in Obsidian\n\nAs I dive into learning, I rely heavily on Obsidian to capture my thoughts and insights. Obsidian's ability to link notes helps me create a web of interconnected ideas, making it easier to navigate through complex topics. My notes are simple, focused, and evolve as my understanding deepens.\n\n## From Notes to Content\n\nOnce I have a comprehensive set of notes, I revise and structure them into a coherent blog post. This blog post is not just a random collection of thoughts; it's a well-organized piece of content designed to share what I've learned with the community.\n\n## Publishing with Git\n\nThe final step in my process is publishing. Since my blog content is part of my [elevenco](https://github.com/prajeshElEvEn/elevenco) git repository, updating it is straightforward. A simple `git commit` followed by `git push` is all it takes to share my learning with the world. This seamless integration ensures that my knowledge is not only stored but also shared, contributing to the collective knowledge of the tech community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLearning is a journey, and sharing what you've learned is an essential part of it. By using tools like Obsidian for note-taking and Git for publishing, I can effectively manage my learning process and contribute to the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, having a structured approach to learning and sharing can make a world of difference.\n\n";
