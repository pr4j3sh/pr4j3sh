Running [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) Linux with the sleek and minimalist [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), my setup is tailored for both speed and simplicity.\n\n![Terminal](./term.png)\n\n## Tools of the Trade\n\n- **[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)**: My terminal of choice, blending performance with aesthetics.\n- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** with **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)**: A modern editor setup that’s as flexible as it is powerful.\n- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**: The ultimate tool for capturing thoughts and organizing knowledge.\n- **[Catppuccin Theme](https://catppuccin.com/)**: Every interface element bathed in a soothing, cohesive color scheme.\n- **[FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)**: A font that not only looks great but enhances readability with ligatures.\n\n## Journey to Arch\n\nMy transition from a Windows user, indulging in Photoshop, Premiere, and VS Code, to a dedicated Linux enthusiast, was marked by exploration. I dabbled in Ubuntu, dual-booted with Kali, tested Zorin OS, and eventually found my home in Arch.\n\nThe best part? Arch’s package manager `pacman`, along with `yay`, allows me to install exactly what I need—nothing more, nothing less. Customizability is at its peak with i3wm, letting me craft an environment where everything is at my fingertips. Mouse? Only when I’m creating content; otherwise, it’s all about the keyboard.\n\nFor those interested, my dotfiles are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prajeshElEvEn/dotfiles), showcasing the configurations that make this workstation uniquely mine.\n\n## Thank You\n\nA heartfelt thank you to all the amazing resources, tools, and communities that have guided and supported me on this journey. From the developers who created the tools I now rely on, to the countless tutorials and documentation that made the learning curve less steep—your contributions have been invaluable. Here's to continued learning and growth in this ever-evolving world of tech!\n\n";
