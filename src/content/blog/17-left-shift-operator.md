When working in C++, a simple way to calculate powers of 2 is using the **left shift operator (`<<`)**. This technique is efficient and compact, especially for operations where powers of 2 are needed.

## How Left Shift Works

The expression `1 << m` takes the binary number `1` and shifts it left by `m` positions. This effectively multiplies `1` by \(2^m\). Shifting left by `m` moves all bits `m` places to the left, filling in the rightmost positions with zeros.

### Example Calculation

Let's say you want to calculate \(2^2 = 4\).

1. Start with the binary representation of `1`:
   ```
   0001
   ```

2. Apply the left shift `1 << 2`, shifting left two times:
   - **First shift:** 
     ```
     0010
     ```
   - **Second shift:** 
     ```
     0100
     ```

   The result `0100` in binary equals `4` in decimal, which matches \(2^2\).

### Why Use Bitwise Shift?

Using `1 << m` is faster than calling a power function like `pow(2, m)`, especially in situations where performance matters, such as competitive programming or systems with limited resources.

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple C++ example demonstrating how to use `1 << m` to calculate \(2^m\):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int m = 3; // Let's calculate 2^3
    int result = 1 << m; // This is 2^3

    cout << "2 to the power of " << m << " is: " << result << endl; // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- `1 << m` shifts `1` left by `m` positions, which is equivalent to calculating \(2^m\).
- For `m = 3`, the result is `8`, as \(2^3 = 8\).

This approach can be used in scenarios needing efficient calculations of powers of 2, such as bit manipulation tasks or setting flags in bitfields
## Summary

For powers of 2 in C++:
- Use `1 << m` to calculate \(2^m\).
- This approach is efficient and leverages binary operations for quick computation.
