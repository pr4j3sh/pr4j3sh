Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It’s widely used in web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence. This blog introduces Python basics, including writing your first program, working with variables, and using conditionals, loops, and functions.

### Writing Your First Python Program

A simple "Hello, World!" program in Python looks like this:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### How to Run Python Code

1. **Install Python:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://python.org).
2. **Run Directly:** Save the code in a file, e.g., `main.py`, and execute it:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Interactive Mode:** Use the Python interpreter by typing `python` or `python3` in the terminal.

### Variables in Python

Variables in Python are dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare their type explicitly.

```python
x = 10  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Float
name = "Python"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean
print(x, y, name, is_active)
```

### Declaration and Types

Python allows flexible variable assignments and supports several data types.

```python
# Example of different types
integer = 42
float_num = 3.14
boolean = True
string = "Hello, Python"
print(type(integer), type(float_num), type(boolean), type(string))
```

### Conditionals

Python conditionals use `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

```python
number = 10
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

### Loops

Python provides two primary looping mechanisms: `while` and `for`.

```python
# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1

# For loop
for i in range(1, 6):  # Inclusive of 1, exclusive of 6
    print(f"Iteration: {i}")
```

### Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword.

```python
# Function with a parameter
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function with a return value
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

greet("Python")
result = add(5, 10)
print(f"Sum is: {result}")
```

### Conclusion

Python’s simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners, while its versatility ensures it’s suitable for advanced projects. Experiment with these basics to build a strong foundation and start creating Python programs today!
