MongoDB is a popular **non-relational database** designed to store and manage data as flexible, schema-less documents. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB employs a **denormalized schema** and stores data in **JSON-like documents**, making it highly versatile and scalable for modern applications.

## Key Features of MongoDB

1. **Document-Oriented Storage:**
   MongoDB stores data in the form of documents, which are represented as **JSON objects**. These documents can have nested structures, allowing for a highly flexible data model.

2. **Schema Flexibility:**
   Unlike relational databases that enforce a rigid schema, MongoDB’s collections allow documents to have varying fields and structures, enabling dynamic and evolving applications.

3. **Scalability:**
   MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through **sharding**, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and high traffic.

4. **Rich Query Language:**
   MongoDB provides a powerful query language to perform CRUD operations, aggregation, and text search directly on the data.

5. **High Performance:**
   Its document-based model, combined with indexing and in-memory storage, ensures quick read and write operations.

## Getting Started with MongoDB CLI

### 1. **Start the MongoDB Client**

Begin by starting the MongoDB shell:

```bash
mongosh
```

The shell connects to the MongoDB server and allows you to interact with databases and collections.

### 2. **Show Databases**

To list all existing databases:

```shell
show dbs
```

### 3. **Switch/Create a Database**

Switch to a specific database (or create one if it doesn’t exist):

```shell
use <database_name>
```

The database is created only after inserting data.

### 4. **Show Collections**

To display all collections in the current database:

```shell
show collections
```

### 5. **Insert a Document**

Insert a JSON document into a collection (creates the collection if it doesn’t exist):

```shell
db.<collection_name>.insertOne({ key: "value" })
```

### 6. **Find Documents**

Retrieve all documents from a collection:

```shell
db.<collection_name>.find()
```

### 7. **Update a Document**

Modify specific fields of a document:

```shell
db.<collection_name>.updateOne({ key: "value" }, { $set: { key: "new_value" } })
```

### 8. **Delete a Document**

Remove a single document that matches a condition:

```shell
db.<collection_name>.deleteOne({ key: "value" })
```

### 9. **Drop a Collection**

Delete an entire collection:

```shell
db.<collection_name>.drop()
```

### 10. **Drop a Database**

Delete the current database:

```shell
db.dropDatabase()
```

## Use Cases of MongoDB

1. **Content Management Systems (CMS):**
   Ideal for managing dynamic content like blogs, articles, and media.

2. **Real-Time Applications:**
   Suitable for real-time analytics, IoT, and messaging platforms due to its high-performance capabilities.

3. **E-commerce:**
   Flexible schemas make it perfect for managing products, user profiles, and orders.

4. **Big Data and Analytics:**
   Handles large-scale data with ease, supporting advanced aggregation frameworks.

## Conclusion

MongoDB’s flexibility, performance, and scalability make it a powerful choice for modern applications. Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale system, MongoDB’s document-oriented approach simplifies data modeling and accelerates development.
