- recogninzing
	- system's components
	- their job
	- relationship between them
	- in order to satisfy a requirement
- taking a problem statement - breaking it down into smaller problems - building solution for each problem - building a combined solution that covers most of the major problem
- forms a double diamond

iterative process that may involve multiple rounds of design, testing, and refinement

phase that focuses on high-level design of a software

system design
- understand your problem,audience, requirements
- identify the scope - boundaries
- research/analyze existing systems
- high-level design - components, relationships
- iterate over the design
- documentation
- monitor and improve

designing systems
-  use cases
- constraints
- high level design
- understading bottlenecks
- scaling
