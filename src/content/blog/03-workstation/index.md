In a world where efficiency and customization meet, my [Dell Inspiron](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-in/000181897/inspiron-5502-5509-product-overview) i3 (11th Gen) with 8GB RAM and a 500GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD stands as the powerhouse of my development environment. Running [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) Linux with the sleek and minimalist [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), my setup is tailored for both speed and simplicity.

## Tools of the Trade

- **[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)**: My terminal of choice, blending performance with aesthetics.
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** with **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)**: A modern editor setup that’s as flexible as it is powerful.
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**: The ultimate tool for capturing thoughts and organizing knowledge.
- **[Catppuccin Theme](https://catppuccin.com/)**: Every interface element bathed in a soothing, cohesive color scheme.
- **[FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)**: A font that not only looks great but enhances readability with ligatures.

## Journey to Arch

My transition from a Windows user, indulging in Photoshop, Premiere, and VS Code, to a dedicated Linux enthusiast, was marked by exploration. I dabbled in Ubuntu, dual-booted with Kali, tested Zorin OS, and eventually found my home in Arch.

The best part? Arch’s package manager `pacman`, along with `yay`, allows me to install exactly what I need—nothing more, nothing less. Customizability is at its peak with i3wm, letting me craft an environment where everything is at my fingertips. Mouse? Only when I’m creating content; otherwise, it’s all about the keyboard.

For those interested, my dotfiles are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/prajeshElEvEn/dotfiles), showcasing the configurations that make this workstation uniquely mine.
